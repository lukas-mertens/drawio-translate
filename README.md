# draw.io/diagrams.net translator

This is a small tool to translate draw.io/diagrams.net diagrams. It's not really sophisticated and not guaranteed to work with all kinds of diagrams, I mainly developed it for my own need. It worked on everything I had to translate so far. If there is anything it doesn't handle well yet, feel free to open a PR, although I don't strive for 100% compatibility.
